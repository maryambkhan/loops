##  Loops

## Code journal

- Repo named `loops`
- Created css,js and html files and folders 
- It did not took too long to understand `for loops` but,
- The problem i was having was that i was not able to understand 
  how i am to fetch an element from an array and run it through loop 
  i practiced on fizz-buzz, comma-separated nouns 
- Always make sure i tell the loop right element number and array name 
- Like i have array of nouns, i have to make sure `noun[]` is right
    ![Array Loop](images/array.png)

- I have created a random array of image id's and added them to js and run it through loop
  and printed the whole array on html  
- Hard part was understanding how array works 
  - Key: specify array and element number
